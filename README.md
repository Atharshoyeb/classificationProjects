# Red Wine Quality Prediction Project
### Project Description
The dataset is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

This dataset can be viewed as classification task. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
Attribute Information
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
What might be an interesting thing to do, is to set an arbitrary cutoff for your dependent variable (wine quality) at e.g. 7 or higher getting classified as 'good/1' and the remainder as 'not good/0'.
This allows you to practice with hyper parameter tuning on e.g. decision tree algorithms looking at the ROC curve and the AUC value.
You need to build a classification model. 
Inspiration
Use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'!

# Medical Cost Personal Insurance Project

## Project Description
Health insurance is a type of insurance that covers medical expenses that arise due to an illness. These expenses could be related to hospitalization costs, cost of medicines, or doctor consultation fees. The main purpose of medical insurance is to receive the best medical care without any strain on your finances. Health insurance plans offer protection against high medical costs. They cover hospitalization expenses, day care procedures, domiciliary expenses, and ambulance charges, among others. Based on certain input features such as age, BMI, number of dependents, smoker status, and region, medical insurance costs are calculated.

### Columns
- **age**: Age of primary beneficiary
- **sex**: Insurance contractor gender (female, male)
- **bmi**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body weights that are relatively high or low relative to height. It is an objective index of body weight (kg/mÂ²) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9.
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- **smoker**: Smoking status (yes, no)
- **region**: Beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

### Predict
Can you accurately predict insurance costs?
