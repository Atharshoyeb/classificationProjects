# Red Wine Quality Prediction Project

### Project Description
The dataset relates to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (output) variables are available. The goal is to classify wines based on their quality score (0-10). An interesting approach might be to classify wines as 'good' (score ≥ 7) or 'not good' (score < 7) for binary classification. Hyperparameter tuning on algorithms like decision trees, and evaluating using ROC curve and AUC value is encouraged.
